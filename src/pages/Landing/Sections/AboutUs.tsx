              At the turn of the 19th century, Gen. Jit Shumsher Rana, brother
              of HH Sri Tin Maharaja Bhir Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, hired
              architect Kumar Narsingh Rana to build the most elegant palace in
              Kathmandu. Items such as gilt mirrors, velvet, marble and sunburst
              chandeliers were imported from Europe. The exteriors were
              fashioned in neo-classical style. The construction was completed
              in 1894 A.D. Gen. Jit Shumsher died in 1913, and this palace
              eventually came into the possession of Gen. Maharajkumar Agni
              Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana - the son of HH Sri Tin Maharaja Juddha
              Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, one of the most distinguished of the
              powerful Rana Maharajas. Agni Shumsher's grand-daughters - HM
              Queen Aishwarya, HM Queen Komal and HH Princess Prekshya, were
              born in the palace.

              Honoring Our Founder‚Äôs Dream In 1950 A.D., the visionary Late Mr.
              Hari Prasad Manandhar dreamed of breathing new life into a
              forgotten Rana-era mansion tucked amidst the heart of Kathmandu.
              With an unwavering passion for preservation and Nepalese
              craftsmanship, he began transforming the once-grand residence into
              a welcoming abode for travelers seeking both culture and comfort.
              What began modestly with 18 rooms soon evolved into a beloved
              sanctuary of heritage and hospitality. Today, as Hotel Kathmandu
              Heritage celebrates 75 remarkable years of service, it stands as a

              Prabal Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, a symbol of his enduring legacy and
              contribution to national heritage. His guiding philosophy‚Äîto blend
